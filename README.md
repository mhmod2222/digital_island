# digital_island

# in contrast to the algorithm of finding number of islands in a binary based matrix of zeros and ones

# This algorithm is for finding islands in a digital based matrix, it can take all decimal numbers with no restriction

# diagonal movement is not allowed, so diagonal neighbors are not accounted for
